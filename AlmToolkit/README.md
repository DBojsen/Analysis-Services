### Use cases

Here are a few, but you can use your imagination ðŸ˜€

* Merge branched models. Manage production branches for bug fixes.
* Deploy bug fixes and partial releases.
* Reuse definitions between tabular models for alignment with common business definitions.
* Reuse definitions from self-service models to IT-owned semantic models.

For a detailed list of features and use cases, see the ALM Toolkit and BISM Normalizer  [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/Analysis-Services/blob/master/AlmToolkit/Model%20Comparison%20and%20Merging%20for%20Analysis%20Services.pdf).

### History

The ALM Toolkit codebase started out as the BISM Normalizer Visual Studio extension. ALM Toolkit is decoupled from Visual Studio.

This video covers BISM Normalizer 3 use cases and demo. The use cases still apply to ALM Toolkit.
